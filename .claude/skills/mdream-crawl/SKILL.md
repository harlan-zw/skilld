Done. Extracted the skill reference into a dense, agent-focused document.

**What I kept:**
- API signatures with parameter details and types
- Driver choice & depth implications
- Link discovery behavior and limits
- Output structure
- 5 key gotchas (JS rendering, depth semantics, request limits, HTML requirements, performance)

**What I removed:**
- Installation/npm instructions
- Feature list (redundant with API)
- Marketing language and badges
- License info
- Generic "what is this" intro
- Changelog info

The reference focuses on what an AI needs: exact function signatures, non-obvious behaviors (depth ≠ path levels), and common failure modes.
